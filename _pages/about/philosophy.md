# Philosophy

Backdrop CMS started its existence as a fork of [Drupal](http://drupal.org). Although Backdrop shares a common codebase with Drupal, its core philosophies and [organization]({{ BASE_PATH }}/about/organization/) vary from its parent project. Backdrop is not the "anti-Drupal", as obviously we share many of the same foundations up to the point of divergence.

## Design (and Architect) for the Majority

Thereâ€™s a good rule of thumb within Internet culture called the [1% rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29):

> The number of people who create content on the Internet represents approximately 1% of the people actually viewing that content".

With that in mind, we acknowledge that while it's very important to listen and respond to those who post feedback and participate in the Backdrop issue queue, they only represent a tiny fraction of our end users. When making decisions on how to move forward with future versions of Backdrop, we attempt to include opinions of those who are not so vocal online. This means including opinions from individuals who attend trainings, meetups, and camps; as well as real-world engagements with clients and consumers of Backdrop.

This principle applies not only to the end-users (e.g. site builders and editors) of Backdrop websites, but also the developers who use Backdrop on a daily basis. We strive to build a system that is not only easy to use, but also easy to learn and build upon, with a minimal amount of technical knowledge.

## Extensibility

Backdrop aims to provide a powerful core that can be readily extended through add-on publicly available contributed or handwritten custom modules. Although Backdrop core should provide the most commonly used options that suit the majority, desired features that are not implemented due to their specific use-cases or complexity should be able to extend Backdrop core, as long as it that extensibility is balanced by the tenents of learnability and performance.

## Low Barrier to Entry (Learnability and System Requirements)

Backdrop aims to empower as many people as possible with the freedom of expression. To meet that goal, Backdrop must be able to be deployed on affordable hosting with the most basic requirements. This means not always chasing the popular trends in technology, but adopting proven, common, and learnable systems.

## Open Source

Backdrop has a history steeped in Open Source. We believe that Open Source has the ability to change the world for the better. We are dedicated to continuing this ideal, and all code included with Backdrop is under an Open Source license that allows anyone to use it free of charge, regardless of their beliefs or intentions. All code included with Backdrop has always been, and always will be, Open Source and free.
