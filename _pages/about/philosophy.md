# Philosophy
Backdrop aims to empower as many people as possible with the freedom of expression.

Backdrop CMS started its existence as an offshoot or [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29) of [Drupal](http://drupal.org). Although Backdrop originates from a common codebase with Drupal, its core philosophies and [organization]({{ BASE_PATH }}/about/organization/) are distinct. Backdrop is not the "anti-Drupal", as obviously we share many of the same foundations up to the point of divergence.

## Design (and Architect) for the Majority

Thereâ€™s a good rule of thumb within Internet culture called the [1% rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29). It states, "the number of people who create content on the Internet represents approximately 1% of the people actually viewing that content".

So while we acknowledge that it's very important to listen and respond to those who post feedback and participate in the Backdrop issue queue, they represent only a tiny fraction of our end users. When making decisions on how to move forward with future versions of Backdrop, we attempt to include opinions of those who are not so vocal online. This means including opinions from individuals who attend trainings, meetups, and camps as well as real-world engagements with clients and consumers of Backdrop.

This principle applies not only to the end users (e.g. site builders and editors) of Backdrop websites, but also the developers who use Backdrop on a daily basis. We strive to build a system that is not only easy to use, but also easy to learn and build upon, with a minimal amount of technical knowledge. While the more vocal parts of our community may be more experienced developers, we always need to keep in mind the developers who are newer (and less vocal) within the project.

## Extensibility

Backdrop aims to provide a powerful core that can be readily extended through publicly available contributed or handwritten custom modules. Although Backdrop core should provide the most commonly used options that suit the majority, Backdrop core should be easily extended to provide desired features that are not implemented due to their specific use cases or complexity--as long as that extensibility is balanced by the tenets of learnability and performance.

## Low Barrier to Entry (Learnability and System Requirements)

To meet the goal of empowering as many people as possible with the freedom of expression, Backdrop must be able to be deployed on affordable hosting with the most basic requirements. Achieving this goal will mean not always chasing the popular trends in technology, but adopting proven, common, and learnable systems.

## Open Source

Backdrop has a history steeped in Open Source. We believe that Open Source has the ability to change the world for the better. We are dedicated to continuing this ideal, and all code included with Backdrop is under an Open Source license that allows anyone to use it free of charge, regardless of their beliefs or intentions. All code included with Backdrop has always been, and always will be, Open Source and free.
