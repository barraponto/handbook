#Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a problem with Backdrop, first try searching or asking the question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/backdrop) and tag the question with "[backdrop](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/backdrop)".

If you're sure it's a bug with the software, search and then file an issue in the [Backdrop Issue Tracker](http://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues).

##Organizing Issues

Github's issue tracker has limited functionality when it comes to organizing issues. The primary tool for organization is using **labels**. Unfortunately, only "committers" on a project can use labels, so Backdrop uses a dedicated (empty) repository to which anyone may be granted access.
