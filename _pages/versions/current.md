# Current Versions

Backdrop is currently under development of its first version, **1.0**. As such, there is no version in the "Primary" portion of its life-cycle yet. At this point, building sites or add-on modules Backdrop is not recommended. If you're anxious to get involved with Backdrop, you can help development by submitting [core code and pull requests]({{ BASE_PATH }}contribute/code/).
